# Learn Pandas
This repository showcases some tutorials related to Pandas, also has some test questions.


- Pandas is an open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. 
- It provides easy-to-use data structures, such as **DataFrames** and **Series**, that allow for efficient handling of structured data, such as tables or time series.
- Pandas enables operations like filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and handling missing data, making it an essential tool for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

### [Creating DataFrames in Pandas](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/creating_dataframes.md)

- In pandas, the primary data structure is the **DataFrame**, which is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure that can hold different types of data (e.g., integers, strings, floats). 
- You can create a DataFrame from various sources such as dictionaries, lists, or external files.


### [Reading CSV Files in Pandas](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/reading_csv.md)

- In pandas, you can easily read data from a CSV file using the `read_csv()` function. 
- This function allows you to load the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame, making it easier to manipulate and analyze.

### [Writing DataFrames to CSV in Pandas](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/writing_csv.md)

- In pandas, you can save a DataFrame to a CSV file using the `to_csv()` method. 
- This allows you to store your DataFrame for future use or sharing.

### [Changing Data Types in Pandas](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/casting.md)

- In pandas, changing data types of columns is often necessary for data analysis. 
- The `astype()` method allows you to convert the data type of a column, and you can also change the data type of multiple columns at once.

As now you have a basic understanding of Pandas, here's an opportunity to showcase how much have you learned and how much you can implement. As I believe, reading and watching is one thing and doing is another and doing makes us better.

### [Selecting Rows and Columns using `loc` and `iloc` in Pandas](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/selections.md)

- In pandas, `loc` and `iloc` are used to access a group of rows and columns in a DataFrame by labels or integer-based indexing, respectively.

### [Some basic syntax](https://github.com/RahulRoy-rsp/Learn_Pandas/blob/main/base.md)

- Pandas has a lot of methods to use, but there are some basic methods that one must always remember dealing with rows and columns.

Let's practice these new concepts practically.
